		<i>This is still a work in progress so please bare with me!</i> <br>
		Eventually, I'm planning on adding my dissertation, a majority of my MS Data Science coursework/projects, and any other data science/statistics/mathematics/computer science project I work on for fun! 
		In the meantime, however, feel free to contact me via email or connect with me on LinkedIn, both of which could be found above!

			<h2> <u>About me</u> </h2>
			I am currently pursuing a Master of Science (MS) in Data Science at Lancaster University, which is regarded as one of the top universities in the United Kingdom according to every major publication, and has also been named the "University of the Year" according to The Times and The Sunday Times Good University Guide 2018. [<a href="http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/news/articles/2017/lancaster-named-university-of-the-year/">1</a>]
			Upon completing my masters program, I am hoping to move back home to the United States in order to utilize my statistical and technical skills as a data scientist. As for my current interests within data science and machine learning, I am extremely interested in problems regarding natural language processing and multi-agent artificial intelligence.<br><br>
			Previously, I graduated from the University of San Francisco with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics as well as a minor in Computer Science and proceeded to work as a microgravity project intern from June 2016 to April 2017 at the NASA Ames Research Center with an objective of analyzing the effects that the absence of gravity has on organisms.
